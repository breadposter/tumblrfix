# tumblrfix

Firefox extension to make Tumblr more usable. 100% based on personal idiosyncracies (and quickly learning how extensions work).

## Functionality

* Removes posts with filtered tags from dashboard entirely.
* Removes posts with filtered content too.

## Notes

* This extension has not been tested with infinite scrolling.
* I'm aware it sometimes randomly doesn't remove posts properly. I'll look into what causes that when I feel like coming back to it.
